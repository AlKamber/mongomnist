# MNIST Classification with Keras, using MongoDB to fetch data

This project demonstrates how to build a simple MNIST classification model using Keras, and how to fetch data from MongoDB.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script for data fetching, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- `upload_data.py`: The script for uploading the MNIST data to MongoDB.
- `requirements.txt`: The dependencies for the project.
- `test_datafetch.py`: The script for testing the data fetching from MongoDB.
- `python_app.yml`: The conda environment for the project handling the dependencies and the workflow actions.
